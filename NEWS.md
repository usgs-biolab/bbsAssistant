# bbsAssistant 2.0.0

__2020.10.17__  Added the USGS BBS analysis results (Sauer *et al.*) as a data object.

__2020.09.09__  The BBS observations and analysis results datasets have each moved to a permanent digital repository at the USGS ScienceBase. As a consequence, many of version 1.0.0 functions need to be heavily modified. This version represents the removal of defunct functions associated with the former location of the datasets. 

The major functionality at this point in the package (this version, that is) is the `get_bbs_data()` function, which wraps numerous functions to grab the most recent version of the observations dataset. Minor releases will occur in the coming weeks, and will be released as super minor versions when necessary.
