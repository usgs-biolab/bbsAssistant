## ALERT  
Due to changes in the location of the BBS observations and results datasets, this package is undergoing a transformation (written 2020-09-09). 

Currently (as of 2020-09-09), we are working on the following and in the following order:  

- Providing the most recent Sauer analysis results as data objects
- Updating the subsetting functions
- Functions for obtaining old observations dataset versions
- Functions for obtaining old analysis results
- Updating the taxonomic matching capacity
- Mapping and visualization features


## About
_This repository contains the development version of __bbsAssistant__. Please submit [Issues here](https://github.com/TrashBirdEcology/bbsAssistant/issues). Major releases will be pushed to the [this repository](https://github.com/usgs-biolab/bbsAssistant) and to the [USGS ScienceBase digital repository](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5de53a0fe4b02caea0e8fa72).

This R package contains functions for downloading, importing, and munging the the observations data and the analysis results from the [North American Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/) (BBS) [via USGS ScienceBase repository](https://sciencebase.gov/). This package was created to allow the user to bulk-download the BBS point count and related (e.g., route-level conditions) via the ScienceBase API (using [R package `sbtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sbtools), and to quickly subset the data by taxonomic classifications, jurisdictional boundaries, and geospatial bounding boxes.

### Citations

## Quick Start
### Installing __bbsAssistant__
Install the development version of this package using devtools and load the package and dependencies:
```{r install, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("trashbirdecology/bbsAssistant", 
                         ref="main", # ensure it pulls from the 'main' branch. Function may still default to 'master' branch.
                         force=TRUE) # force to get most recent dev version
library(bbsAssistant)
```

## Quick Start
Start here to quickly retrieve the most recent version of the BBS observations dataset (this dataset currently contains >6.5 million rows). The BBS datasets are typically released on an annual basis, and comprise the QA/QC'd dataset containing observations from years 1966 to the most recent. __Unless you are reproducing analyses of historical versions of the BBS annual releases, the most recent release should suffice for your purposes.__ 

We have stored a data package inside `bbsAssistant` called __bbs_recent__ containing the most recent observations dataset. Retrieve the most recent data in the package:
```{r bbs_recent, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE} 
data <- bbsAssistant::bbs_obs
```
or download the data files directly:
```{r bbs_recent2, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE} 
sb_id = "5ea04e9a82cefae35a129d65" #specify the item identifier 
```

## BBS Data Availability
There are currently two primary products released from the USGS that are derived from the annual BBS roadside surveys, the [observations data](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/52b1dfa8e4b0d9b325230cd9) and the analysis results. The datasets (observations, results) are permanently and publicly available at [USGS ScienceBase](http://sciencebase.gov). 

The most recent annual releases of the observations and results datasets are stored as data objects in this package (see `data(bbs)`) will be downloaded as the default in this package, but the user has the option to specify historical dataset releases should they choose. Please see the function `get_bbs_data()`.

```{r dataset-lookup,  eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
datasets <- bbsAssistant::sb_items
```
A lookup table containing the available datasets (N = `r length(unique(datasets$sb_item))`) and analysis results will be regularly updated, and comprises the following entries: 
```{r datasets, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
datasets %>% select(-legacy_format, -sb_parent) %>%  
  relocate(sb_item, .after = last_col()) %>%
  kable(caption="List of datasets currently available for download at USGS ScienceBase. Highlighted and bold row indicates the default BBS observations dataset stored internally in the package.") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = TRUE, position = "left") %>% 
  column_spec(1, width = "40em") %>% 
  row_spec(1, background = "yellow", bold = TRUE)
```

## Vignettes and package manual
VIGNETTES ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION DUE TO PACKAGE OVERHAUL/MAKEOVER!
<!-- For function descriptions please build the manual (`devtools::build_manual("bbsAssistant)`) and for an example build the vignette(s) (`devtools::build_vignettes()`; or run `/vignettes/vignettes.Rmd`); or visit the [package website]().  -->
